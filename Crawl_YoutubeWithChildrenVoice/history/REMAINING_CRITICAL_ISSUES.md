## Issues Found During Double-Check

### ✅ CRITICAL #1: Incorrect Path Depth Check (3 instances in filtering_phases.py) - FIXED

**File:** `src/filterer/filtering_phases.py` (Lines 189, 205, 326)  
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Data Loss/Path Resolution Failure  
**Fix Applied:** Changed all three instances from `< 2` to `< 3`

**Lines Fixed:**

- Line 189: `if len(manifest_file.parents) < 2:` → `< 3` ✅
- Line 205: `if len(manifest_file.parents) < 2:` → `< 3` ✅
- Line 326: `if len(manifest_file.parents) < 2:` → `< 3` ✅

**Why Critical:**

- When manifest file path has only 2 parents, accessing `[2]` would cause IndexError
- Could result in path resolution failures during file movement
- Data loss when files can't be properly moved to language folders

### ✅ CRITICAL #2: Incorrect Rollback Logic in download_phases.py - FIXED

**File:** `src/downloader/download_phases.py` (Lines 444-477)  
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Data Loss
**Fix Applied:** Only pop() new records, don't pop() when updating existing records

**Issue:**
The rollback code used `manifest_data['records'].pop()` unconditionally. When updating an existing record (not appending), pop() would remove the LAST record in the list, not the modified one. This caused catastrophic data loss.

**Fix Logic:**

```python
if not existing_record:
    # Only pop if this was a new record append
    manifest_data['records'].pop()
    manifest_data['total_duration_seconds'] -= record['duration_seconds']
# else: existing record was modified in-place, no rollback needed
```

**Lines Fixed:**

- Lines 444-453: First rollback instance
- Lines 477-490: Second rollback instance (file move failure)
