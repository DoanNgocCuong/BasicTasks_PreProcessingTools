## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Immediately)

### CRITICAL #1: Incomplete Manifest Record Fields in Download Phase

**File:** `src/downloader/download_phases.py` (Lines 241-300)  
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Data Integrity  
**Impact:** Created records missing required fields for proper processing

**Problem:**
When creating a new manifest record for a successfully downloaded audio, the code creates an incomplete record:

```python
record = {
    "video_id": video.video_id,
    "url": video.url,
    "output_path": str(new_path),
    "status": "success",
    "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat() + "Z",
    "duration_seconds": result.duration or 0.0,
    "title": get_video_title(...),
    "language_folder": language_info,
    "download_index": download_index,
    "classified": False,
    "file_available": True
}
```

**Missing Critical Fields:**

- `containing_children_voice` (should be `None`)
- `voice_analysis_confidence` (should be `0.0`)
- `classification_timestamp` (should be `None`)
- `uploaded` (should be `False`)
- `file_available` should explicitly be `True`

**Why This Breaks Things:**

- Filtering phase expects these fields and may crash with `KeyError`
- Upload phase checks `containing_children_voice` and will skip records with missing fields
- Manifest becomes inconsistent between newly downloaded and previously analyzed records

**Fix Required:**
Add all required fields to the record dictionary:

```python
record = {
    "video_id": video.video_id,
    "url": video.url,
    "output_path": str(new_path),
    "status": "success",
    "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat() + "Z",
    "duration_seconds": result.duration or 0.0,
    "title": get_video_title(...),
    "language_folder": language_info,
    "download_index": download_index,
    "classified": False,
    "classification_timestamp": None,
    "containing_children_voice": None,
    "voice_analysis_confidence": 0.0,
    "uploaded": False,
    "file_available": True
}
```

### CRITICAL #2: Manifest Record Missing Required Fields When Download Fails

**File:** `src/downloader/download_phases.py` (Lines 411-428)  
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Data Integrity  
**Impact:** Failed record incomplete, breaks downstream phases

**Problem:**
When a download fails, a failed record is created with incomplete fields:

```python
failed_record = {
    "video_id": video.video_id,
    "url": url,
    "output_path": None,
    "status": "failed",
    "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat() + "Z",
    "duration_seconds": 0.0,
    "title": get_video_title(...),
    "language_folder": "unknown",
    "download_index": len(manifest_data['records']),
    "classified": False,
    "file_available": False,
    "all_downloads_failed": True
}
```

**Missing Critical Fields:**

- `classification_timestamp`
- `containing_children_voice`
- `voice_analysis_confidence`
- `uploaded`

**Why This Breaks Things:**

- Inconsistent schema across manifest records
- Other phases expect all records to have the same fields
- Clean phase will set missing fields to defaults, but this is unreliable

**Fix Required:**
Include all required fields in failed record creation.

---

### CRITICAL #3: Workspace Root Resolution Can Fail with Insufficient Path Depth

**File:** `src/analyzer/analysis_phases.py` (Lines 142-153)  
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Processing Failure  
**Impact:** Analysis phase silently skips records when path depth is insufficient

**Problem:**

```python
# Safety check: ensure manifest path has sufficient depth
if len(manifest_file.parents) < 2:
    output.error(f"Cannot resolve workspace root for {video_id}: manifest path has insufficient depth")
    output.error(f"Manifest path parents: {list(manifest_file.parents)}")
    continue  # SILENTLY CONTINUES!

workspace_root = manifest_file.parents[2]
```

The check for insufficient depth just continues to next record, but then uses `manifest_file.parents[2]` which could be out of bounds or wrong index.

**Correct Path Should Be:**

- Manifest is at: `workspace/output/final_audio/manifest.json`
- Parents: `[final_audio, output, workspace_root]` (indices 0, 1, 2)
- So `parents[2]` is correct only if path has 3+ parents
- But the check is for `< 2` when it should check for `< 3`

**Why This Breaks Things:**

- Analysis records might reference completely wrong paths
- Files might be found in wrong locations or not at all
- Silent failures make debugging very difficult

**Fix Required:**

```python
# Should be: < 3, not < 2
if len(manifest_file.parents) < 3:
    output.error(f"Cannot resolve workspace root: manifest path {manifest_file} has insufficient depth")
    continue
```

---

### CRITICAL #4: Race Condition in Filtering Phase File Operations

**File:** `src/filterer/filtering_phases.py` (Lines 225-235)  
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Data Loss/Race Condition  
**Impact:** Files can be lost during concurrent filtering operations

**Problem:**
Between checking if a file exists and moving it, another process could delete/move it:

```python
if not output_path.exists():
    # File might have been moved by another process
    output.warning(f"Source file disappeared during processing for {video_id}: {output_path}")
    record['file_available'] = False
    records_to_keep.append(record)
    continue

try:
    output_path.rename(target_path)  # What if output_path was deleted between check and rename?
```

**The Fix Exists but Comment is Misleading:**
The code already has the check for the case where file disappears, but it's checking AFTER the continue, so it won't help.

**Why This Breaks Things:**

- In concurrent operations (batch processing), multiple phases could run on same records
- File could be moved/deleted between the existence check and the rename
- Partial updates to manifest could leave records pointing to non-existent files

**Fix Required:**
Wrap the rename in try-except:

```python
try:
    output_path.rename(target_path)
except FileNotFoundError:
    output.warning(f"Source file disappeared during rename for {video_id}: {output_path}")
    record['file_available'] = False
    records_to_keep.append(record)
    continue
```

---

### CRITICAL #5: Language Folder Path Traversal Vulnerability

**File:** `src/filterer/filtering_phases.py` (Lines 205-212)  
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Security  
**Impact:** Potential directory traversal attacks via crafted language_folder values

**Problem:**
Although the code has a sanitization comment, it only removes separators but doesn't validate:

```python
# SECURITY FIX: Sanitize language_folder to prevent path traversal attacks
# Remove any path separators and suspicious characters
language_folder = language_folder.replace('\\', '').replace('/', '').replace('..', '').strip()
if not language_folder:
    language_folder = 'unknown'
```

**Issues with this sanitization:**

1. It only removes separators AFTER they appear, but `..` could be obscured
2. A value like `..hidden` would become `hidden` after the replace
3. Unicode characters or other tricks could bypass this
4. The sanitization happens but doesn't validate against a whitelist

**Why This Breaks Things:**

- If `language_folder` comes from untrusted sources (like malformed manifest), could escape `final_audio_dir`
- Could overwrite files outside intended directory

**Fix Required:**
Use whitelist validation:

```python
language_folder = record.get('language_folder', 'unknown')
# Validate against whitelist of known languages
VALID_LANGUAGES = {'vi', 'en', 'unknown', 'unclassified'}
if language_folder not in VALID_LANGUAGES:
    language_folder = 'unknown'
```

### CRITICAL #6: Clean Phase Workspace Root Calculation is Off by One

**File:** `src/cleaner/clean_manifest.py` (Lines 27-31)  
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Processing Failure  
**Impact:** Files not found during cleaning, paths calculated incorrectly

**Problem:**

```python
workspace_root = manifest_dir.parents[1]  # WRONG - should be [2] or [1]?
# Manifest is at: workspace/output/final_audio/manifest.json
# parents = [final_audio (0), output (1), workspace (2)]
# So it should be manifest_dir.parents[2] or manifest_path.parents[3]
```

**Comparison with other phases:**

- `analysis_phases.py`: Uses `manifest_file.parents[2]` (from `manifest.json`)
- `filtering_phases.py`: Uses `manifest_file.parents[2]` (from `manifest.json`)
- `clean_manifest.py`: Uses `manifest_dir.parents[1]` (from parent of manifest)

This inconsistency will cause files not to be found during cleaning.

**Why This Breaks Things:**

- File path resolution fails
- `find_file_recursively` starts from wrong directory
- Files in subdirectories won't be found
- Manifest records will have incorrect paths

**Fix Required:**

```python
# manifest_path is at: workspace/output/final_audio/manifest.json
# manifest_path.parents[0] = final_audio
# manifest_path.parents[1] = output
# manifest_path.parents[2] = workspace
workspace_root = manifest_path.parents[2]
```

---

### CRITICAL #7: Unclassified Records Not Preserved During Filtering

**File:** `src/filterer/filtering_phases.py` (Lines 155-168)  
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Data Loss  
**Impact:** Unclassified records that should wait for analysis are lost

**Problem:**
When processing with `video_ids` specified (partial filtering), unclassified records are kept but then can be lost during deduplication or update:

```python
if not record.get('classified', False):
    # Not yet classified, keep for now
    # But validate it has required fields
    video_id = record.get('video_id')
    if not video_id:
        output.warning(f"Skipping unclassified record with missing video_id: {record}")
        entries_removed += 1
        continue
    records_to_keep.append(record)
    continue
```

Later, during partial update handling:

```python
if video_ids is not None:
    # Build final records list: Keep processed + non-processed
    for record in unique_records:  # Only processed records here
        ...
    for record in all_records:  # Then add non-processed
        if video_id not in processed_video_ids and video_id not in final_seen_ids and video_id:
            final_records.append(record)
```

**The Problem:**

- If a record is unclassified and NOT in `video_ids`, it should still be kept
- But if deduplication removes it, it's gone
- The code tries to preserve it but the logic is fragile

**Why This Breaks Things:**

- Unclassified records (waiting for analysis) get deleted
- Data loss when doing partial filtering
- Users have to re-download these files

**Fix Required:**
Add explicit preservation of unclassified records with better logic.

### CRITICAL #8: No Verification That Downloaded Files Actually Exist After Rename

**File:** `src/downloader/download_phases.py` (Lines 311-318)  
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Data Integrity  
**Impact:** Manifest records created for non-existent files

**Problem:**

```python
try:
    if new_path.exists():
        new_path.unlink()
    result.output_path.rename(new_path)
    result.output_path = new_path
    output.debug(f"Successfully moved file to: {new_path}")
except Exception as e:
    output.error(f"Failed to move file for {video_id}: {e}")
    # ... rollback happens here
```

**The issue:**

- After successful rename, we don't verify the file actually exists at the new location
- On some filesystems (network drives, etc.), rename could appear to succeed but file might not be there
- Manifest is already saved with the new path

**Why This Breaks Things:**

- Filtering phase will find that file doesn't exist
- Analysis phase will skip these "missing" records
- Users lose data without knowing why

**Fix Required:**

```python
try:
    if new_path.exists():
        new_path.unlink()
    result.output_path.rename(new_path)

    # Verify file actually exists at new location
    if not new_path.exists():
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"File not found at {new_path} after move (filesystem inconsistency)")

    result.output_path = new_path
    output.debug(f"Successfully moved and verified file at: {new_path}")
except Exception as e:
    # ... rollback
```

## üü† HIGH-PRIORITY ISSUES

### HIGH #1: Language Detector Initialization Errors Not Properly Handled

**File:** `src/crawler/search_phases.py` (Lines 161-181)  
**Severity:** HIGH - Analysis Accuracy  
**Impact:** Language filtering disabled silently, wrong videos processed

**Problem:**
Multiple places where language detector fails to initialize but processing continues:

- `search_phases.py`: Initializes but sets to `None` if fails, then checks `if language_detector:` which passes
- `download_phases.py`: Similar pattern
- Detection failures are logged but don't stop the query processing

**Impact:**

- Videos are not filtered by language properly
- Vietnamese-only requirement is bypassed
- Non-Vietnamese videos get included in dataset

---

### HIGH #2: Batch Processing Callback Exception Not Properly Caught

**File:** `src/crawler/search_phases.py` (Lines 248-256)  
**Severity:** HIGH - Pipeline Failure  
**Impact:** One query error stops entire search phase

**Problem:**

```python
try:
    await batch_callback(include_upload=True)
    last_batch_count = current_url_count
except Exception as e:
    output.error(f"Failed to execute batch callback: {e}")
    import traceback
    output.error(f"Full traceback: {traceback.format_exc()}")
    # NO RE-RAISE but also NO CONTINUE - falls through!
```

When batch callback fails, we don't continue to next batch, but we also don't stop. The search phase just keeps going, potentially losing batches.

---

### HIGH #3: Manifest Deduplication Can Lose Unprocessed Records

**File:** `src/filterer/filtering_phases.py` (Lines 273-312)  
**Severity:** HIGH - Data Loss  
**Impact:** When filtering specific videos, other unprocessed records can be lost

**Problem:**

```python
if video_ids is not None:
    # Build final records list
    final_seen_ids = set()
    final_records = []

    # Add processed records
    for record in unique_records:
        video_id = record.get('video_id')
        if video_id and video_id not in final_seen_ids:
            final_records.append(record)
            final_seen_ids.add(video_id)

    # Add non-processed records
    for record in all_records:
        video_id = record.get('video_id')
        if video_id not in processed_video_ids and video_id not in final_seen_ids and video_id:
            final_records.append(record)
            final_seen_ids.add(video_id)
```

**The issue:**

- `unique_records` comes from `records_to_keep` which was filtered
- `records_to_keep` might not include all records due to early skips and continues
- Unclassified records that should be kept might be in neither list

---

### HIGH #4: Upload Phase Temporary Manifest Not Cleaned Up on All Error Paths

**File:** `src/uploader/upload_phases.py` (Lines 99-123)  
**Severity:** HIGH - Resource Leak  
**Impact:** Temporary manifest files accumulate on disk

**Problem:**
Cleanup only happens in explicit error handling but not if `upload_main` raises an unexpected exception type:

```python
try:
    global _current_upload_folder_id
    total_uploads = 0

    if _current_upload_folder_id is None:
        _current_upload_folder_id, uploads_count = upload_main(...)
    else:
        _current_upload_folder_id, uploads_count = upload_main(...)

    # Cleanup happens here
    if temp_manifest_path is not None:
        try:
            temp_manifest_path.unlink(missing_ok=True)
except Exception as e:
    # Cleanup also happens here
    if temp_manifest_path is not None:
        try:
            temp_manifest_path.unlink(missing_ok=True)
```

But if an exception happens during the success path (before cleanup code), the temp file is left behind.

---

### HIGH #5: No Atomicity Guarantee for Manifest + File Rename Operations

**File:** `src/downloader/download_phases.py` (Lines 280-318)  
**Severity:** HIGH - Data Consistency  
**Impact:** Manifest says file is at location A, but it's actually at location B

**Problem:**
The code tries to save manifest BEFORE moving file:

```python
# Save manifest BEFORE moving file
file_manager.save_json(manifest_file, manifest_data)

# Now move the file
output_path.rename(new_path)
```

But if the rename fails after manifest is saved, we have inconsistency. The code does attempt rollback, but the rollback itself is fragile:

```python
except Exception as e:
    # Rollback manifest changes since file move failed
    try:
        manifest_data['records'].pop()  # Assumes last record was the one we added!
        manifest_data['total_duration_seconds'] -= record['duration_seconds']
        file_manager.save_json(manifest_file, manifest_data)
```

**Issues:**

- Assumes last record is the one that failed (not true if concurrent access)
- If rollback save fails, we're in an inconsistent state
- No transaction-like behavior

---

### HIGH #6: Classification Timestamp Validation Logic May Accept Invalid States

**File:** `src/filterer/filtering_phases.py` (Lines 183-191)  
**Severity:** HIGH - Data Quality  
**Impact:** Records with incomplete classification data are processed as complete

**Problem:**

```python
# CRITICAL FIX #3: Validate that classified records have ALL required classification fields
containing_children_voice = record.get('containing_children_voice')
classification_timestamp = record.get('classification_timestamp')

# Check if classification is complete
if containing_children_voice is None or classification_timestamp is None:
    output.warning(f"Skipping {video_id}: classified=True but missing required fields...")
    record['file_available'] = False
    records_to_keep.append(record)
    continue
```

**The issue:**

- `containing_children_voice` could be `False` (which is falsy in Python!)
- `if containing_children_voice is None` should catch this, but it's easy to make mistakes
- Better to check `classified` field explicitly

---
