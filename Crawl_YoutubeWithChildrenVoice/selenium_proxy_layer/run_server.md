Yes, it’s running correctly.

- 503 at root is normal for a forward proxy.
- Use these to verify:

```bash
# Admin status (should return JSON)
curl http://0.0.0.0:8080/_proxy_admin/status

# Proxy a request (shows your egress IP)
curl -x http://0.0.0.0:8080 https://httpbin.org/ip

# HTTPS test
curl -I -x http://0.0.0.0:8080 https://example.com
```

Tip:
- Replace `0.0.0.0` with the server’s real IP (e.g., `103.253.20.30`) when calling from another machine.
- Since it binds to `0.0.0.0`, consider firewalling or restricting access if exposed publicly.

Got it. Here’s exactly what to do in a NEW terminal.

If crawler runs on the SAME machine as the proxy:
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/cuong_dn/BasicTasks_PreProcessingTools
source .venv/bin/activate
export HTTP_PROXY="http://127.0.0.1:8080"
export HTTPS_PROXY="http://127.0.0.1:8080"
python youtube_video_crawler.py
```

If crawler runs on a DIFFERENT machine (proxy on 103.253.20.30):
```bash
# On the crawler machine
source .venv/bin/activate
export HTTP_PROXY="http://103.253.20.30:8080"
export HTTPS_PROXY="http://103.253.20.30:8080"
python youtube_video_crawler.py
```

Optional sanity check before running:
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/_proxy_admin/status
curl -x http://127.0.0.1:8080 https://httpbin.org/ip
```

Notes:
- Keep the proxy server running (your `launcher.py` session).
- If some internal services should skip the proxy, set `NO_PROXY="127.0.0.1,localhost"` as needed.

# In a NEW terminal
