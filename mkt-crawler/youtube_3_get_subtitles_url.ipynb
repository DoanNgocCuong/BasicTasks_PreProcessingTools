Click here: https://pocenglish.com/landing\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nDo you want to improve your speaking in English? Of course you do! It is every English learner's dream to speak English fluently and easily! But do you know how? In this lesson, I'll show you 3 Tips and 10 Steps to improve your English speaking skill! Plus, you will see many examples of how you can practice speaking in English! \\n\\nHere are some frequent questions about speaking in English:\\nWhy can I understand, but can't speak? \\nI don't have a speaking partner, how can I practice?\\nWhat if I make mistakes and there is no one to correct me? \\n\\nIn order to become more fluent in English, you have to speak, and speak, and speak in English. There is no other way. However, you don't need a speaking partner to do this! you can speak with yourself! \\n\\nAnother reason why many students are afraid to talk in English is due to lack of confidence. A very good practice to improve your confidence is to pretend as if you are presenting something to an imaginary audience. Stand up and ready something aloud, and make eye contact from time to time! \\n\\nTo be a good English speaker, you need to think in English. If you think in English, you will talk in English too! But how? You can keep a journal of the things you want to do during the day, or the things you did on that day. Plus, you should talk to yourself in English! this time, not aloud! Talk to yourself in your head. \\n\\nI hope you enjoyed this lesson. If you want to improve your speaking and pronunciation, here are some videos I highly recommend:\\n\\nForget Words When Speaking English? Here Is Why!\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNhZnH9bQLc\\n\\nUnderstand English But Can't Speak? Here's Why!\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3MuLYO6wQk\\n\\nHow To Speak English Fast And Understand Native Speakers\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlHM3HRFrTA\\n\\nDon't forget to give a thumbs-up!

It is every English learner's dream to speak English fluently and easily! But do you know how? In this lesson, I'll show you 3 Tips and 10 Steps to improve your English speaking skill! Plus, you will see many examples of how you can practice speaking in English! \\n\\nHere are some frequent questions about speaking in English:\\nWhy can I understand, but can't speak? \\nI don't have a speaking partner, how can I practice?\\nWhat if I make mistakes and there is no one to correct me? \\n\\nIn order to become more fluent in English, you have to speak, and speak, and speak in English. There is no other way. However, you don't need a speaking partner to do this! you can speak with yourself! \\n\\nAnother reason why many students are afraid to talk in English is due to lack of confidence. A very good practice to improve your confidence is to pretend as if you are presenting something to an imaginary audience. Stand up and ready something aloud, and make eye contact from time to time! \\n\\nTo be a good English speaker, you need to think in English. If you think in English, you will talk in English too! But how? You can keep a journal of the things you want to do during the day, or the things you did on that day. Plus, you should talk to yourself in English! this time, not aloud! Talk to yourself in your head. \\n\\nI hope you enjoyed this lesson. If you want to improve your speaking and pronunciation, here are some videos I highly recommend:\\n\\nForget Words When Speaking English? Here Is Why!\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNhZnH9bQLc\\n\\nUnderstand English But Can't Speak? Here's Why!\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3MuLYO6wQk\\n\\nHow To Speak English Fast And Understand Native Speakers\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlHM3HRFrTA\\n\\nDon't forget to give a thumbs-up!
